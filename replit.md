## Data Flow

### Employee Onboarding Flow
1. Admin creates employee record with basic details
2. System generates temporary password
3. Automated onboarding email sent with login credentials
4. Employee receives email and logs in for first time
5. Mandatory password reset enforced

### Attendance Flow
1. Employee accesses punch-in interface
2. System captures timestamp, IP address, and geolocation
3. Work mode automatically determined (onsite/offsite)
4. Attendance record stored in database
5. Real-time dashboard updates for admin monitoring

### Leave Request Flow
1. Employee submits leave request with details and optional documents
2. System validates leave balance availability
3. Request enters pending status
4. Admin reviews and approves/rejects request
5. Automated email notification sent to employee
